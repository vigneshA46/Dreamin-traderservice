This is an intraday NIFTY option buying strategy (MIS) where strike selection is based on the NIFTY index, and trades are executed on high-delta options (Δ ≥ 0.85) for both CE and PE, each traded independently on 1-minute charts. The close of the first 1-minute candle on the option chart is marked as a reference line, and for every candle an average price is calculated using (𝑂+𝐻+𝐿+𝐶)/4
(O+H+L+C)/4 from option LTP values. A buy entry is taken on the next candle when a candle closes above the marked line and its average price is below the candle close, indicating momentum strength. A normal exit condition is always active: if any candle closes below the marked line, the trade is exited immediately, and this exit rule operates independently of the trailing stop-loss logic.

Alongside the normal exit, the strategy uses a fixed target of 70 points and a dynamic trailing stop-loss (TSL). The initial TSL is placed at +30 points from the entry price, and trailing becomes active only when any candle touches this TSL level. Once activated, the stop-loss is set 10 points below the TSL. If price continues to move in favor and advances 10 points above the current TSL, both the TSL and SL are moved up by 10 points, progressively locking in profits. During the trailing phase, the trade exits only when a candle closes below the current SL. After a TSL-based exit or target hit, the next trade is always taken with 1 lot, and a fresh entry is allowed only after price first moves below the marked line and then again satisfies the original entry conditions, ensuring disciplined resets before re-entry.
